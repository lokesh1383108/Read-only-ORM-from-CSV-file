# Read-only-ORM-from-CSV-file


Design and implement a simple read-only ORM that works with CSV files. The ORM should support list and get queries.
Assume that the CSV file has a column called ID that is unique to every row. 
If you got this far, as an added bonus, add filtering functionality that takes a column name and a matching value
